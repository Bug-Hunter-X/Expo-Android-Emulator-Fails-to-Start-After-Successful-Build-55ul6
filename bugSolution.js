The solution involved deleting all existing Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) and creating a new one with specific configurations.  Before creating the new AVD, make sure to stop all running emulators.  Then, use the Android Studio AVD Manager to create a new AVD with the recommended settings. This resolved the issue.  The emulator then successfully started after building the Expo project.  Additional debugging steps (not included in this minimal solution) involved checking for conflicts with other running applications that might interfere with the emulator.
