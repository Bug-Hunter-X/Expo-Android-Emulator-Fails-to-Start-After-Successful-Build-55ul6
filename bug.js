While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the Android emulator wouldn't start, even after successfully building the project.  The build process completed without errors, but the emulator remained unresponsive. This was perplexing because other projects worked fine. My attempts to reinstall Expo, clear the cache, and even create a new project didn't resolve the issue.
